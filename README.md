**Systems Architect | Deterministic AI Infrastructure**

Author of the NS-L6 Standard and the Deterministic System Specification. My engineering focus lies in establishing deterministic state-transition semantics within AI environments, structurally separating stochastic computational substrates from formally verifiable, deterministic infrastructural state.

## 📄 Normative Specifications & Standards

### [NS-L6 Standard](https://github.com/jan-zdrahal/ns-l6-standard)
**Official Web:** [ns-l6.org](https://ns-l6.org)
A unified, formally structured responsibility architecture for human–LLM systems. It introduces a seven-layer model (L0–L6) with strict non-invertibility, formal axioms, and mathematically grounded responsibility boundaries.

### [Deterministic System Specification](https://github.com/jan-zdrahal/deterministic-system-specification)
Defines the abstract transition semantics of deterministic state-transition systems (v0.1). This architecture-neutral specification establishes the formal deterministic system model `DS = (S, I, R, Valid)`, explicit structural axioms (Domain Restriction, Totality, Uniqueness), and execution semantics independent of any underlying implementation or execution environment.

## ⚙️ Deterministic Stack Infrastructure

### [Deterministic Ledger](https://github.com/jan-zdrahal/deterministic-ledger)
An append-only public log serving as a declarative registry for structural artifacts. It provides strict chronological ordering, deterministic hash references, and explicit UTC timestamp context to establish cryptographic proof-of-existence for components within the deterministic architectural stack.
